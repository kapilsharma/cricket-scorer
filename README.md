# Cricket Scorer

This is an app I'm making to practice different backand/frontend frameworks. Main directory contains three folders:

- frontend
- backend
- requirements

`frontend` and `backend` folders will again contains further sub-folders named as framework/library like angular, react, vue (in frontend) and express, loopback, laravel etc on backend, representing the framework used and are main project folders.

`requirements` folder is for defining requirements of the project.
